# üíª Analysis of Developer Survey 2019 (stackoverflow)

In order to learn data analysis, I analyzed "Developer Survey 2019" data, each step of the code is given in the form of comments (in English). <br>

All functions are accompanied by comments to facilitate an understanding of their function and working principle. <br>

A small part of the code has no comments, although the functions in these codes are commented on.  <br>

This repository processes four main types of data: Developer Profile, Technology, Work, Community.  <br>


#### Codes without comment: 
* Work_Analyzed_Data
* Community_Analyzed_Data
